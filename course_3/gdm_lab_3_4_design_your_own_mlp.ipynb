You created different model structures by changing the layer and neuron numbers. You saw how these changes affected the model performance and how it separated the different classes (\"mat\", \"apple\", \"bank\"). You also generated your first training and test loss curves. This exercise gave you practical experience implementing neural networks, demonstrating firsthand how their structure influences the learning process.\n",
