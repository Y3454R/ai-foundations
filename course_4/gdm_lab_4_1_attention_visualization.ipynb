        "In this lab, you will explore how transformer models make their predictions. Transformer models rely heavily on a so-called **attention mechanism**. This mechanism allows the model to build contextual embeddings that combine information from all tokens in the prompt. When training a transformer model, this mechanism learns how much each token in the prompt should be attended to. That is, how much weight should be placed on the information of each token when building a contextual embedding to predict the next token.\n",

        "\n",
        "Unlike in the pen-and-paper exercise you did at the beginning of this course, transformer models do not decide just once which tokens are important. Instead, they have many **layers** and the attention mechanism operates on each layer. For example, the Gemma-1B model has 26 layers.\n",
