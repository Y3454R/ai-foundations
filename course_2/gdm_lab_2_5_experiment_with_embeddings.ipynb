        "In this lab, you explored the **high-dimensional token embeddings** of the Gemma model using the `numpy` library to perform vector and matrix operations. You implemented **cosine similarity** to mathematically measure the \"closeness\" of tokens, confirming that words with similar meanings (like \"king\" and \"queen\") are located near each other in the embedding space. You then discovered the challenge of **visualizing** these vectors, finding that plotting individual dimensions directly revealed little about the overall structure. Finally, by using a **dimensionality reduction technique** called t-SNE, you successfully projected the embeddings into 2D and observed how the model organized words into meaningful **semantic clusters**, grouping related concepts together."
