Through this implementation, you have observed how BPE iteratively **merges** frequent character pairs to create **subword tokens**. This process is crucial for handling the vast and dynamic nature of human language. It is especially important in the context of **large vocabulary sizes** and the need to represent **out-of-vocabulary tokens**. Understanding BPE and other subword tokenization techniques is critical for anyone working with language models. It directly impacts model performance, efficiency, and the ability to handle diverse text data.\n",
