In the case of the language model you will be training, each paragraph from the Africa Galore dataset constitutes an example. The input should therefore be a matrix that has the IDs of every token in a paragraph.

This is done by adding `<PAD>` tokens at the beginning or the end of the paragraph. This results in all paragraphs having exactly the same length so that they can be combined in one matrix.\n",

When training a model, however, it is generally best to include a very diverse set of paragraphs in one batch.
