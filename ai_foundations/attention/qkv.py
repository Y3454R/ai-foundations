  """Extracts Q, K, and V matrices from the qkv dictionary for a given layer.

  This function can operate in two modes depending on the `head` parameter:
  1.  **Multi-head mode**: Returns lists of Q, K, and V matrices
      for all attention heads.
  2.  **Single-head mode:** Returns single Q, K, and V matrices
      for the specified attention head.

  Args:
      qkv: Dictionary with layer-wise Q, K, and V matrices.
      layer: The layer number from which to extract the matrices.
      head: The specific attention head to extract. If None, all heads are
        processed and returned as lists.

  Returns:
      If `head` is an integer, a tuple of three JAX arrays (Q, K, V) for that
      head.
      If `head` is None, a tuple of three lists of JAX arrays, representing
      the Q, K, and V matrices for all heads.

  Raises:
      AssertionError: If the specified layer or head is not valid.
