  This function verifies two specific properties of the tokenization for the
  word "Clusterophonexia":
  1. That it is split into exactly four subword tokens.
  2. That the first subword token correctly decodes to "Cluster".

  It also decodes and prints each individual token and its corresponding ID for
  manual inspection. If any assertion fails, it prints a user-friendly
  error message.

  Args:
    clusterophonexia_tokens: A list of integer IDs representing the tokens for
      the word "Clusterophonexia" after tokenization.
    first_token_as_text: The decoded string representation of the first token in
      the list.
    gemma_tokenizer: An initialized Gemma tokenizer instance used for decoding
      the token IDs back to text.
